# Chart_Converter
A set of tools to convert different charts from different rhythm games.
    
Now support: Dynamix, Deemo, Project Sekai(WIP).  
More games will be supported in the future.
## Description
Due to the difference in chart format, there is no way can directly play one game's charts in other games.   
These tools will help you convert supported games' charts to other platforms and play them (if the game can import third-party maps).  

The converter doesn't convert the charts to the target game directly, but it will first transform the maps to a universal format, then continually convert them to the form that the target game supported. 
  
You can submit the converter, which can transform a universal-format chart to the game you want to be supported, to this repository. If the format standard doesn't contain special map elements (like flicker, hold, etc.), you can add the element and parameter to the standard.
  
This repository will not provide modified games. You may test and play the converted map in malody(slide), bestdori, solonus, etc.
